-- Chapter 1

    Green achieved quite abit of proggress, by completing 2 quests in the caverns, 1 quest in the weald,
meeting up with Red and gathering quite the crowd of followers. He gathered some useful trinkets,
picked up some great and not so great quirks and managed to get himself kicked out of the bar a
few times... It was a wild 3-4 weeks, but as was agreed upon when Green and Red found the Raging
Dragons group(soon or not so soon to be guild), it was now time to leave the leadership to Red for a 
few weeks. ("Good luck friend! May your quests be bountiful!" ~ Green @ Red)
