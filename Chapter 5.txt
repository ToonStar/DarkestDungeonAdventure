-- Chapter 5

   The time had come for Green to take the lead and so he did. Though he did not think it possible, he was
actualy surprised at how far Red went with wasting the resources... The "Raging Dragons" were broke
flat and Green could barely afford the gold for some provisions to send a team of the weakest members
on an almost suicidal quest in the courtyard that promissed some resources and blood. The lack of decent 
heroes made everyone was so desperate, they didn`t even question him sending Hogan the abomination on
the quest. Still by the mad rule of Red alot of the heroes had improved including Green himself. And so this
desperate quest to earn a bare minimum of resources went ok, but not in the best possible manner... Two
were inflicted with the damned Crimson curse which made Green restless for all the mouths he had to
throw blood in every week... Nevertheless the quest did provide enough resources for a more substantial
expedition to be launched and so Green did not hesitate. The second expedition went quite well dispite the
fact that one more had been cursed Crimson... With all the resources, Green managed to pay for most of
the stronger heroes` treatments since they were either mad or sick. And so the third week came and Green
actually managed to launch a quest for better riches which he went on himself, a quest worthy of his skill! 
The quest went very well, noone was hurt badly, alot was gained. Alot of heroes got stronger in thiese short
weeks, but it was time for Red to take the lead again. But before we part ways, I think I should mention - 
Green was as sneaky as ever in his deeds. After hearing a rumor about another abomination pretty close
he made a quick choice to lessen the burden of the cursed members, so he had Hogan kicked and throwing
some coins under the table, to the rumored abomination had him take Hogan`s place and call himself the
same so Red wouldn`t notice. All was done behind the scenes of course, so no harm done, right?
