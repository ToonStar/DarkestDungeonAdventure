			--== Raging Dragons ==--

    This log booklet tells the tale of two friends, brothers even, who were of humble beginnings, 
but with noble hearts and souls. The tale might be fascinating to some, or dull to others, but mark
my words, it is as true and real as YOU are to the final word. Now sit back and relax as we dive
into the depths of this mistifying story.

    Our story begins with the first meeting of our heroes in the small town by the name of Hamlet, 
later to also be known as The Raging Dragons Locale. It was a cold, misty night in Hamlet, Green
was just back from his first quest into the caverns, with a few of his friends when they met Red.
Green and Red had alot in common and Red was fascinated by the thought of taking on a quest.
They just saw eye to eye, those two, it was like fate brought them together. That night they spent
hours, sharing their experience, knowledge, dreams(over quite a few, maybe abit too much, drinks
at the bar) and they realised their presception of perspective is one and the same. They wanted to
make a name for themselves, by proving their mettle in glorious battle and exploration and then
they wanted to make their own guild that will spread the fantasmous name that they thought of
(After a surprisingly strong burp from Green which almost sounded like a roar): "Raging Dragons".
And from that day forward their journey, perhaps towards the pits of hell or to the piedestal of glory,
began!
